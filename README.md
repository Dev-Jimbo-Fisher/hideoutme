# Update #1 - 12/10/19 at 9:30pm

Today, I started the creation of a discord bot. The bot is focused around support. We are createing this bot for the sole person is the help people with issues and help trying to fix them. We also focus on user friendly stuff. 

# Update #2 - 12/10/19 at 9:45pm

Added the basic code for the funtion of the bot to login and turn on in the discord server.
Added a token.json file - It holds the private bot token for the bot to turn on properly.
Added a botSettings.json - It holds the prefix for now.

# Question #1 - 12/10/19 at 10:00pm

Created a issue, The issue stated a question about adding something to the bot for staff members and announcements inside of the discord server. Do we want to have a custom message embeds in the bot for regular staff members to use for like announcements and other stuff.

We also made it clear if they wanted to see this in the discord bot to add a check mark reaction to the post in the discord. That's if they properly read the message. It also states that we are currently using the Carl bot from Carl.gg to use custom embeded messages for all our inportant or announcement messages.

# Notice from Jimbo Fisher

Personal asked Cyberoptic if he wanted to make a discord bot with me. He did say yes, So as of this moment we have another Bot Developer on the team. We are going to keep all logs of what we do. It doesn't matter if its the simplest update or a issue. Just log it to keep track of the progess that we are making.
